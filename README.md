# Traversy-Media-Jest-Basic-Testing
## General info
Basic unit testing practices done with Jest testing framework
## Installation
* Install Node.js
* Clone the repo on your local device
* Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
* Execute `npm install` to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json.
## Testing
To run Jest, use one of following options:
* `npm test` to run tests
* `npm run testwatch` to run the tests in watch mode, which automatically re-runs tests on file changes
## Dependencies
* axios: ver 1.4.0
* jest: ver 29.6.0
## Inspirations & Resources
* [Traversy Media YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r4xVDI2vho)
* [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/)
## Conclusions & Issues
* After going through the Jest docs, this was my next step to becoming more familiar with testing in Javascript. It covers basic setup, different matchers, simple async functions testing, running functions after/before tests, etc.
* I'm eager to dive deeper and use Jest with real-world data applications.
